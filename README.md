It enabled stakeholders to monitor performance indicators and supported data-driven strategies to optimize distribution and sales growth.

1. Monitoring and evaluating sales performance effectively
2. Optimizing product distribution across regions
3. Identifying market trends and customer behavior

**üéØ Objective**
This project was carried out as part of a Business Intelligence initiative to help the company:
